Post CrossFit WODs to your WordPress site.

== Description ==

Post CrossFit WODs to your WordPress site.

Adds a custom WOD post type to the native WordPress dashboard. This will allow you to have an area of your dashboard dedicated to creating, editing, and publishing WODs while keeping your other content such as blog posts, pages, and media separate.

The WOD post type uses the native WordPress interface for editing WODs, so you can include links, pictures, videos or short-codes with your WODs just as you can in a blog post or page.

By default, WODs display to whatever page you have set to list your recent posts.

However, since Version 1.1 of the plugin, there is also a WOD widget included so you can display your recent WODs in a sidebar, footer, or any other location your theme allows placement of a widget.
